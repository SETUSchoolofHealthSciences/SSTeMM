  </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Processing of the User’s personal data is needed for the operation of the Application - in 
        the scope of the following data: personal reflections, stress signature scores</li>
      <li>the User's consent to processing of its personal data – personal data are processed only on

  <p>
    <strong>7.7 User’s rights related to the processing of personal data and making automated decisions.</strong> 
    The User has the following rights as the data subject:
  </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>the right to access to personal data,</li>
      <li>the right to withdraw consent to personal data processing,</li>
      <li>the right to request the rectification of personal data, </li>
      <li>the right to request the erasure of personal data (right to be forgotten), </li>
      <li>the right to request the restriction of the processing of personal data, </li>
      <li>the right to object to the processing of personal data due to specific situations, </li>
      <li>the right to personal data portability, i.e. the right to receive personal data in a structured, 
        commonly used, machine-readable IT format. The User can send this data to another data controller 
        or request that the Operator send such data to another data controller. However, the data controller 
        will only do this if such transfer is technically possible.<p>
      The right to portability personal data applies only to those data that are
        processed on the basis of a performance of a contract with the User or on the 
        basis of the User’s consent. To exercise the above rights, please contact the 
        data controller (contact details are stipulated in points 1 and 2 above). In a 
        situation where the processing of personal data is based on the consent of the data 
        subject, the provision of personal data by the User to the data controller is 
        voluntary. Providing personal data by the User is obligatory when the legal 
        basis for processing of personal data is a legal provision or an agreement 
        concluded between the parties. 
  </p>
  </li>
        <li>the right to withdraw consent. In so far as the User’s personal data is processed 
          on the basis of the User’s consent - the User has the right to withdraw its consent 
          to processing of personal data at any time. Withdrawal of consent does not affect 
          the lawfulness of the processing that was carried out on the basis of the consent 
          given before such withdrawal. Consent may be withdrawn by sending a statement of
           withdrawal of consent to the post address or email address of the data controller. </li>
           </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>7.8 Right to lodge a complaint with authority.</strong> If the User becomes aware of unlawful
     processing of personal data, the User also have the right to lodge a complaint with 
     the supervisory authority dealing with personal data protection i.e. The Irish Data 
     Protection Commission (<a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie">www.dataprotection.ie</a>).
  </p>
  <h3>8 Severability clause</h3>

    affect the legal validity of the remaining provisions.
